## Decision Checklist

### Part 1: Strategic Alignment

**Question 1: Do you believe the core insight?**
> "Flyberry already IS premium (Fortune 500 clients, ‚Çπ7,249 hampers) but lacks brand storytelling to communicate this to B2C consumers."

- [ ] ‚úÖ Yes, this resonates - we have hidden assets
- [ ] ‚ùå No, I don't see the gap
- [ ] ü§î Partially - need more evidence

**Question 2: Is the Fortune 500 credential authentic and provable?**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Yes, we actually serve Google, Facebook, Goldman Sachs (have invoices/contracts)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially - we've done some corporate work but it's not Fortune 500
- [ ] ‚ùå No, this is overstated

**Question 3: Can we execute the brand story shift?**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Yes, founder/team ready to embrace "premium lifestyle brand" positioning
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe - need to convince internal stakeholders
- [ ] ‚ùå No, we prefer to stay operations/product-focused

**Question 4: Is the timing right?**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Yes, now is the perfect time (market opportunity, competitive threats)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe - other priorities might compete for resources
- [ ] ‚ùå No, too many other urgent issues

### Part 2: Financial Viability

**Investment Breakdown** (Estimated):

| Phase | Duration | Investment | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Phase 1** | Weeks 1-4 | ‚Çπ10-15 Lakhs | Website updates, packaging redesign, brand narrative development |
| **Phase 2** | Weeks 5-8 | ‚Çπ15-20 Lakhs | Product architecture, pricing strategy, limited editions |
| **Phase 3** | Weeks 9-12 | ‚Çπ15-20 Lakhs | Physical store transformation (5 stores), digital experience |
| **Phase 4** | Weeks 13-16 | ‚Çπ10-15 Lakhs | Content marketing, PR launch, partnerships |
| **Total** | 16 weeks | ‚Çπ50-75 Lakhs | Full brand transformation |

**Budget Reality Check**:
- [ ] ‚úÖ We have ‚Çπ50-75 Lakhs available for brand investment
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è We have budget but need to phase it (maybe Phase 1 first, then decide)
- [ ] ‚ùå Budget is not available right now

**ROI Confidence**:
Based on the audit findings (premium pricing +‚Çπ100-‚Çπ200/SKU, corporate gifting growth, etc.):

- [ ] ‚úÖ High confidence - the numbers make sense, we can see the path to +‚Çπ50 Crores
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium confidence - directionally right but need to validate assumptions
- [ ] ‚ùå Low confidence - too speculative

---

### Part 3: Organizational Readiness

**Question 1: Do we have internal champion(s)?**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Founder/CEO is personally committed
- [ ] ‚úÖ Marketing head is enthusiastic
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Some resistance from operations/sales teams
- [ ] ‚ùå No clear internal champion

**Question 2: Can we dedicate resources?**
- [ ] ‚úÖ We can assign 1-2 FTEs to work with agency/consultants
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Team is stretched but can manage
- [ ] ‚ùå No bandwidth - everyone is firefighting

**Question 3: Are we ready for change?**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Excited to transform from operations-focused to brand-focused
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Some nervousness about changing what's working
- [ ] ‚ùå Risk-averse, prefer incremental changes

---

### Part 4: Competitive Urgency

**Question 1: Is there competitive threat?**
- [ ] ‚úÖ HIGH URGENCY - Competitors like Happilo, Farmley are scaling fast
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - We have time but should move soon
- [ ] ‚ùå LOW - We're comfortable with current position

**Question 2: Can competitors replicate our advantages?**
- [ ] ‚ùå NO - Fortune 500 relationships take years to build (our moat is strong)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY - They can't get Google/FB but can build premium positioning
- [ ] ‚úÖ YES - Anyone can claim premium positioning

**Question 3: First-mover advantage on "Fortune 500 trusted" positioning?**
- [ ] ‚úÖ YES - If we claim it now, competitors can't (authentic story)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE - Not sure if this resonates with consumers
- [ ] ‚ùå NO - Doesn't matter who claims it first

## Key Questions to Answer Before Deciding

### Financial Questions:
1. What's our current customer acquisition cost (CAC)?
2. What's our current customer lifetime value (LTV)?
3. If we increase prices by ‚Çπ100-‚Çπ200, what % of customers will we lose? (price elasticity)
4. What's our current corporate gifting revenue? (baseline for +50% growth)

### Strategic Questions:
1. Can we get explicit permission from Google, Facebook, Goldman Sachs to showcase the relationship?
2. Do we have case studies (like Sodexo Hope Gift Box) that we can publicize?
3. What does our founder want Flyberry to become in 5 years? (lifestyle brand or distribution company?)

### Tactical Questions:
1. Who will lead this transformation internally? (Name, role, % time allocation)
2. Which agency/consultant will we partner with? (brand strategy, design, content)
3. What's our rollout sequence? (website first, then packaging, then stores?)
