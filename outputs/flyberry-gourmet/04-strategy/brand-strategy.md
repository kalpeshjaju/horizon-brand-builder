## Visual Direction

**Design Principles**:

- Digital-First Scalability: Design every element to perform beautifully across digital platforms while maintaining impact in physical retail environments
- Distinctive Sophistication: Stand apart from traditional gourmet food branding through unexpected color combinations and modern typography while respecting category conventions

**Color Strategy**: Primary palette centers on deep berry tones (burgundy, blackberry) to convey richness and premium quality, balanced with warm neutrals (cream, soft gold) for approachability. Accent colors include sage green for natural freshness and soft coral for contemporary warmth, creating emotional connections of comfort, indulgence, and trust while differentiating from competitors' predictable earth tones.
- Rich berry primary (deep burgundy #722F37) as brand anchor, suggesting premium ingredients and sophisticated taste

- Fresh accent colors (sage green #9CAF88, soft coral #E07A5F) for contemporary appeal and digital optimization

**Typography**: Modern serif primary typeface with subtle organic curves that reference natural berry shapes while maintaining premium credibility. Clean, geometric sans-serif secondary font for digital readability and contemporary appeal. Typography hierarchy emphasizes contrast between elegant display usage and highly legible body text, with custom letterform treatments that incorporate subtle 'flight' elements through ascending letterforms and flowing connections.

**Imagery Guidelines**:
- Hero Photography: Artisanal lifestyle shots with natural lighting, featuring products in contemporary kitchen settings with emphasis on texture, color vibrancy, and premium ingredients in use
- Product Photography: Clean, minimalist styling on neutral backgrounds with dramatic lighting that creates depth and premium perception, incorporating subtle movement through flowing sauces or scattered ingredients
